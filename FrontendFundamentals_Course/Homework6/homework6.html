  Why I love Tacos
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
  Tacos are a popular <span class="first-span">Mexican dish</span> consisting of a folded or rolled tortilla filled with a variety 
  of ingredients such as seasoned meat, cheese, lettuce, salsa, and guacamole. 
  I love tacos because they're incredibly versatile‚Äîwhether you prefer spicy, 
  savory, or even <span>vegetarian</span>, there's always a taco to match your mood. 
  The combination of fresh ingredients and <span>bold flavors</span> in each bite makes them a satisfying and delicious meal. 
  Plus, they're fun to eat and can be customized to suit anyone's taste!

  What makes a good Taco?
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
  Tacos should look vibrant and inviting, with warm, slightly crisp tortillas encasing a colorful mix of ingredients like juicy, 
  seasoned meat or fresh veggies, topped with vibrant garnishes such as cilantro, onions, and a squeeze of lime. 
  They should smell mouthwateringly fragrant, a blend of savory spices, grilled meat, and fresh herbs. 
  The taste should be a perfect balance of flavors‚Äîsavory, spicy, tangy, and slightly sweet, with a satisfying contrast in textures from the tender filling 
  and the soft or crispy tortilla.</p>
